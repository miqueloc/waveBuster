# Wave Buster

Wave buster is a simple script to run on google sheets to get waves conditions from http://magicseaweed.com

How it works?

- Request access to the API on [magicseaweed API] (http://http://magicseaweed.com/developer/api)
- Create a google spreadsheet like the one in the picture to store the data

- On the google spreadsheet, go to Tools/script editor. You can add the googleSheetScript.js
- Change the parameters for your API key and the spot_id you want.
